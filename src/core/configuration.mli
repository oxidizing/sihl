(** A module to manage service configurations.

    An appâ€™s configuration is everything that is likely to vary between deploys
    (staging, production, developer environments, etc).

    This includes:

    - Resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing services
    - Credentials to external services such as Amazon S3 or Twitter
    - Per-deploy values such as the canonical hostname for the deploy

    (Source: {{:https://12factor.net/config} https://12factor.net/config}) *)

(** {1 Storing configuration}

    Configuration might come from various sources like .env files, environment variables
    or as data provided directly to services or the app. *)

exception Exception of string

(** A list of key-value pairs of strings representing the configuration key like SMTP_HOSt
    and a value. *)
type data = (string * string) list

(** The configuration contains configuration data and a configuration schema *)
type t

val store : data -> unit
val make : ?schema:(unit, 'ctor, 'ty) Conformist.t -> data -> t
val empty : t
val data : t -> data
val commands : t list -> Command.t list

(** A configuration is a list of key-value string pairs. *)

(** {1 Reading configuration}

    Using the schema validator conformist it is easy to validate and decode configuration
    values. Conformist schemas can express a richer set of requirements than static types,
    which can be used in services to validate configurations at start time.

    Validating configuration when starting services can lead to run-time exceptions, but
    they occur early in the app lifecycle. This minimizes the feedback loop and makes
    sure, that services start only with valid configuration. *)

val read : (unit, 'ctor, 'ty) Conformist.t -> 'ty

(** [fetch schema t] returns the decoded, statically typed version of configuration [t] of
    the [schema]. This is used in services to declaratively define a valid configuration.

    The configuration data [t] is merged with the environment variable and, if present, an
    .env file.

    It fails with [Exception] and prints descriptive message of invalid configuration. *)

(** [read_string key] returns the configuration value with [key] if present. The function
    is memoized, the first call caches the returned value and subsequent calls are fast. *)
val read_string : string -> string option

(** [read_int key] returns the configuration value with [key] if present. the first call
    caches the returned value and subsequent calls are fast. *)
val read_int : string -> int option

(** [read_bool key] returns the configuration value with [key] if present. the first call
    caches the returned value and subsequent calls are fast. *)
val read_bool : string -> bool option

(** [is_testing ()] returns true if SIHL_ENV is set to [testing] *)
val is_testing : unit -> bool
