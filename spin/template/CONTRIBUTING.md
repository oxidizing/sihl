## Setup your development environment

You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can install the dependencies in a new local switch with:

```bash
make switch
```

Or globally, with:

```bash
make deps
```

Then, build the project with:

```bash
make build
```

### Running Binary

After building the project, you can run the main binary that is produced.

```bash
make start
```

### Running Tests

You can run the test compiled executable:

```bash
make test
```

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

```bash
make doc
open-cli $(make doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(make doc-path)`
