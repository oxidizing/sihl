        [not_allowed_handler] is used if an unsafe request does not pass the
        CSRF protection check. By default, [not_allowed_handler] returns an
        empty response with status 403.

        [key] is the key in the session cookie under which a CSRF token will be

        Internally, the CSRF protection is implemented as a Double Submit Cookie
        approach. [session_key] is the name of the session cookie the CSRF token
        should be stored in. By default, the value is [_session]. If you want
        the CSRF cookie to use a [__Host] prefix, you have to adjust the session
        cookie key.

        [input_name] is the name of the input element that is used to send the
        CSRF token. By default, the value is [_csrf]. It is recommended to use a
        [<hidden>] field in a [<form>].

        [secret] is the secret used to encrypt the CSRF cookie value with. By
        default, [SIHL_SECRET] is used.

        is either `text/html` or `application/json`, depending on the
        `Content-Type` header of the request. If SIHL_ENV is `development`, a
        more detailed debugging page is shown which makes development easier.
        You can override the error page/JSON that is shown by providing a custom
        error handler [error_handler].

        Optional email configuration [email_config] can be specified, which is a
        tuple (sender, recipient, send_function). Exceptions that are caught
        will be sent per email to [recipient] where [sender] is the sender of
        the email. Pass in the send function of the Sihl email service or
        provide your own [send_function].

        An optional custom reporter [reporter] can be defined. The middleware
        passes the request and the stringified exception to the reporter
        callback. Use the reporter to implement custom error reporting. *)

        requests. A typical use case is displaying error messages after
        submitting forms.

        [cookie_key] is the cookie name. By default, the value is [_flash].

        The flash data is stored in a separate flash cookie. The usual
        limitations apply such as a maximum of 4KB. Note that the cookie is not
        signed, don't put any data into the flash cookie that you have to trust. *)

        assigns it to the request.

        assigned to the request. The random id is a 64 byte long base64 encoded
        string. There is no uniqueness guarantee among ids of pending requests.

        highly unlikely. *)

        warning page in case there are pending migrations. The middleware shows
        a generic internal error page if [SIHL_ENV] is [production] to not leak
        information.

        [fetch_pending_migrations] is a function that returns a list of pending
        migrations. Use the [pending_migration] function of the migration
        service. If the returned list is empty, there are no pending migrations.*)

        [/foo/bar].
