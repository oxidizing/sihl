  (** [router ?back scope] returns a router that can be passed to the web server
      to serve the job queue dashboard.

      [back] is an optional URL which renders a back button on the dashboard.
      Use this to provide your admin user a way to easily exit the dashboard. By
      default, no URL is provided and no back button is shown.

      [scope] is the URL path under which the dashboard can be accessed. It is
      common to have some admin UI under [/admin], the job queue dashboard could
      be available under [/admin/queue].

      You can use HTMX by setting [HTMX_SCRIPT_URL] to the URL of the HTMX
      JavaScript file that is then embedded into the dashboard using the
      <script> tag in the page body. HTMX is used to add dynamic features such
      as auto-refresh. The dashboard is perfectly usable without it. By default,
      HTMX is not used. *)

  (** [dispatch ?ctx ?delay input job] queues [job] for later processing and
      returns [unit Lwt.t] once the job has been queued.

      An optional [delay] determines the amount of time from now (when dispatch
      is called) up until the job can be run. If no delay is specified, the job
      is processed as soon as possible.

      [input] is the input of the [handle] function which is used for job
      processing. *)

  (** [dispatch_all ?ctx ?delay inputs jobs] queues all [jobs] for later
      processing and returns [unit Lwt.t] once all the jobs has been queued. The
      jobs are put onto the queue in reverse order. The first job in the list of
      [jobs] is put onto the queue last, which means it gets processed first.

      If the queue backend supports transactions, [dispatch_all] guarantees that
      either none or all jobs are queued.

      An optional [delay] determines the amount of time from now (when dispatch
      is called) up until the jobs can be run. If no delay is specified, the
      jobs are processed as soon as possible.

      [inputs] is the input of the [handle] function. It is a list of ['a], one
      for each ['a job] instance. *)

      instances that match the search parameters.

      The [filter] has exactly match or be part of the search tag of the job
      instance.

      A tuple is returned, where the second value describes the total number of
      rows found, ignoring [limit]. This is useful to implement pagination. *)

      registered does nothing. *)
