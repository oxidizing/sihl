(** A module to create Sihl apps. *)

(** An app is a thin convenience layer on top of the service container. It
    provides hooks that are executed at different stages in the app lifecycle. *)
type t

(** [empty] returns an app without any services. *)
val empty : t

(** [with_services services app] adds [services] to an [app]. *)
val with_services : Core_container.Service.t list -> t -> t

(** [before_start f app] registers a callback f with [app]. The callback is
    executed before any service is started. This means you must not use any
    services here! *)
val before_start : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> t -> t

(** [after_stop f app] registers a callback f with [app]. The callback is
    executed before after services are stopped. This means you must not use any
    services here! *)
val after_stop : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> t -> t

(** [run ?commands ?log_reporter app] is the main entry point to a Sihl app and
    starts the command line interface with [commands] merged with the commands
    provided by services.

    An optional [log_reporter] can be provided to change the logging behavior.
    The default log reporter logs to stdout. *)
val run
  :  ?commands:Core_command.t list

(** [run' ?commands ?log_reporter app] is analogous to [run]. It is a helper to
    be used in tests that need [Lwt.t]. *)
