  (** [prepare_search_request ~search_query ~count_query ~filter_fragment
      ?sort_by_field type] returns a prepared SQL statement
      ['a prepared_search_request] by assembling the SQL query from the provided
      fragments.

      [search_query] is the [SELECT ... FROM table] part of the query.

      [count_query] is a query that is executed by Sihl after the search in
      order to obtain the total number of items in the table. For example
      [SELECT COUNT(\*\) FROM table].

      [filter_fragment] is the fragment that is appended to [search_query] for
      filtering. Usually you want ot [OR] fields that are often searched for.
      For example
      [WHERE table.field1 LIKE $1 OR table.field2 $1 OR table.field3 LIKE $1].

      [sort_by_field] is an optional field name that is used for sorting. By
      default, the field "id" is used. Note that in order to prepare the
      requests, the sort field has to be known beforehand. If you want to
      dynamically set the field, you need to write your own query at runtime.

      [type] is the caqti type of an item of the collection. *)

      [prepared_request] and returns a partial result of the whole stored
      collection. The second element of the result tuple is the total amount of
      items in the whole collection.

      [prepared_request] is the returned prepared request by
      {!prepare_search_request}.

      [sort] is the sort order. The field that is sorted by was set by
      {!prepare_search_request}.

      [filter] is an optional keyword that is used to filter the collection. If
      no filter is provided, the collection is not filtered.

      [offset] is the number of items that the returned partial result is offset
      by.

      [limit] is the number of items of the returned partial result.

      [offset] and [limit] can be used together to implement pagination. *)
