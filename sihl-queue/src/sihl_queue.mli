(** [create_job ?max_tries ?retry_delay ?failed handle encode decode name]
    returns a job that can be placed on the queue (dispatched) for later
    processing.

    [max_tries] is the maximum times a job can fail. If a job fails [max_tries]
    number of times, the status of the job becomes [Failed]. By default, a job
    can fail [5] times.

    [retry_delay] is the time span between two retries. By default, this value
    is one minute.

    [failed] is the error handler that is called when [handle] returns an error
    or raises an exception. By default, this function does nothing. Use [failed]
    to clean up resources or raise some error in a monitoring system in case a
    job fails.

    [handle] is the function that is called with the input when processing the
    job. If an exception is raised, the exception is turned into [Error].

    [encode] is called right after dispatching a job. The provided input data is
    encoded as string which is used for persisting the queue.

    [decode] is called before starting to process a job. [decode] turns the
    persisted string into the input data that is passed to the handle function.

    [name] is the name of the job, it has to be unique among all registered
    jobs. *)
