# Issue management app

This issue management app showcases Sihl. It uses `sihl-users` for user management.

## Getting started

Start a local MariaDB instance. You can you `docker-compose` for that.

Run `yarn test` to run all integration tests.

Run `yarn sihl start` to start the web server. The admin UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/admin/login/`.
