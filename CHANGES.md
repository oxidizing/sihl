## [0.4.0] - ?
### Fixed
- Get rid of `Sihl.Web.Middleware.htmx`, `Sihl.Web.Htmx` can be used directly now
- `Sihl.Web.Csrf.find` returns `string option`, use `Option.get` if you are sure that the CSRF middleware has been applied
- Take custom `unauthenticated_handler` for `Sihl.Web.Middleware.bearer_token` and enforce existence of `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header
- Web helpers moved from `Sihl.Web.Http` to `Sihl.Web`. In `Sihl.Web.Http` there is only the Opium based HTTP service.
- Replace middlewares with helpers where they don't have to be middlewares such as bearer token (`Sihl.Web.Request.bearer_token`), htmx (`Sihl.Web.Htmx`) and session (`Sihl.Web.Session`)
- Remove `form` middleware (`Sihl.Web.Middleware.form`), use `Sihl.Web.Request` directly to parse form requests
- Replace `Sihl.Web.Flash.find_custom` with `Sihl.Web.Flash.find` and `Sihl.Web.Flash.set_custom` with `Sihl.Web.Fash.set` to support key-value based semantics. If you need to store your custom string, simply store it under a key like `Sihl.Web.Flash.set [("custom", value)] resp` and retrieve it with `Sihl.Web.Flash.find "custom" request`

### Added
- Read `Request-ID-X` header if present instead of generating a random id for`Sihl.Web.Id`
- Implement composable router API `Sihl.Web.{get, post, ...}` and `Sihl.Web.choose`.
- Implement job queue dashboard for `sihl-queue`

## [0.1.7] - 2020-11-03
### Fixed

- Fixe dune package names, private dune packages don't have generic names like `http` or `database` causing conflicts in a Sihl app

## [0.1.6] - 2020-10-31
### Fixed
- `Database.Service` and `Repository.Service` are assumed to have just one implementation, so they are referenced directly in service implementations instead of passing them as functor arguments

- Merge utils into one `utils.ml` file
#### HTTP API
- `Sihl.Http.Response` and `Sihl.Http.Request` have consistent API

- Split up `Sihl.Data` into `Sihl.Migration`, `Sihl.Repository` and `Sihl.Database`
